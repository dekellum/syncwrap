=== 1.4.0 (TBD)

=== 1.3.0 (2012-10-4)
* Include RHEL/Amazon Linux Postgresql 9.1 config and deploy support
  and reorganize for Ubuntu support as well. Default deploy data dir
  is now /pg/data which makes sense for an EBS mount. Config is
  further tuned for EBS.  PostgreSQL::EC2 has been dropped.
  PostgreSQL::RHEL and PostgreSQL::Ubuntu are auto-included with
  PostgreSQL module if RHEL or Ubuntu is included.
* For performance on relatively slow virtual hosts, only check
  iyyov_install if iyyov_install_jobs( :install => true )
* Add generic etc/gemrc and jruby_install_gemrc (incl in jruby_install)
* Include jstat in list of java command symlinks with java_install
* EC2.ec2_reformat_mnt_as_ext is for ephemoral not EBS, rename
  attribute to ec2_es_device

=== 1.2.1 (2012-9-25)
* Build hashdot with java 1.7.0_07 as well
* Fix lib jruby link on update: --no-dereference

=== 1.2.0 (2012-9-25)
* Touch jobs.rb if not otherwise modified by iyyov_install_jobs. This
  notifies iyyov to restart a daemon when the jobs.rb is otherwise
  unchanged (and using a daemon version range.)
* Upgrade to JRuby 1.6.8 (default)
* Upgrade to Iyyov 1.1.4 (default, in init.d/iyyov)
* Upgrade to java 1.7.0_07
